# 🕸️ Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Project

This Java project demonstrates the construction, manipulation, and recovery of a **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** from a given weighted graph.  
It implements **Prim’s** and **Kruskal’s** algorithms to compare performance and find efficient edge replacements after edge removal.

## 📋 Project Description

The goal of this project is to:
1. Build an MST (Minimum Spanning Tree) from a given weighted graph.
2. Display the MST edges before removing any edge.
3. Remove one edge from the MST.
4. Display the resulting disconnected components.
5. Find and add a replacement edge that reconnects the components **while keeping the graph minimum**.
6. Display the final reconnected MST.

This demonstrates not only your MST implementation but also your ability to efficiently handle **edge removal and reconnection**.
